# Mock restaurant page

Deployed at https://nomad-rest.netlify.app/

Simple website to get more comfortable with Webpack and module management.

The website discards the previous DOM elements every time a new section is clicked, which is dinamically created. 
Thus, at any point, only the displayed elements are loaded on the page.
